We can see a correlation coefficient of 0.818, however this correlation could be spurrious as correlation does not mean causation. An increase in WO students could cause an increase in bear consumption, however these can be correlated by chance, without any mechanism acting between them that actually relates them in the real world. Thus we cannot conclude that these variables are related without further research.
